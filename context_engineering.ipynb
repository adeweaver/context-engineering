    "## What is context engineering?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context engineering** is the discipline of how we structure, retrieve, and manage information so that LLMs can reason effectively. It goes beyond prompts to include instructions, knowledge, tools, retrieval, memory, and governance — all orchestrated to ensure the model has the *right information in the right format at the right time*. As conversations grow longer, the context window becomes a critical bottleneck that can lead to:\n",

    "    - **Context Poisoning**: When a hallucination makes it into the context\n",

    "    - **Context Confusion**: When superfluous context influences the response\n",

    "\n",

    "- **Knowledge (the facts)**: documents, embeddings, domain-specific data, chat history, and long-term memory\n",

    "## State & history: proactive context management with persistence\n",
    "\n",
    "A central challenge in **context engineering** is deciding *how much of a conversation’s history should remain in the model’s context window.*  \n",
    "Too little history, and the agent loses continuity. Too much, and it wastes tokens, increases latency, and risks “context rot.”\n",
    "\n",
    "This section demonstrates **proactive context management** — a strategy that trims older messages *before* they are passed to the model.  \n",
    "By doing this early, the system ensures that only the most recent and relevant user turns are preserved, keeping context focused and performant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "We extend Strands’ built-in `SlidingWindowConversationManager` into a custom **`ProactiveTurnTrimmer`**, which:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trims proactively** → Always keeps only the last *N* user turns before sending the next model call.  \n",
    "- **Preserves continuity** → Maintains conversational flow without unnecessary historical baggage.  \n",
    "- **Optimizes resources** → Ensures predictable token usage and model performance in long-running sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This differs from a *reactive* approach (which trims *after* overflow).  \n",
    "Proactive trimming is like an automatic cleanup crew — keeping your model’s short-term memory clean and coherent before every turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### FileSessionManager — Persistent Session Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "In parallel, we use **`FileSessionManager`** to handle **long-term persistence** of the agent’s state.  \n",
    "While the `ProactiveTurnTrimmer` manages *active context*, `FileSessionManager` preserves *historical memory* between runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What It Does\n",
    "- Stores all messages as structured JSON under `.strands/sessions/...`\n",
    "- Allows sessions to be reloaded or replayed later\n",
    "- Creates a lightweight local “memory layer” for experimentation or auditability\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why It Matters\n",
    "Together, these components embody the **inner and outer loops** of context engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Layer | Mechanism | Function | Context Principle |\n",
    "|:------|:-----------|:----------|:------------------|\n",
    "| **Inner Loop** | `ProactiveTurnTrimmer` | Manage active conversation window | *Isolate* |\n",
    "| **Outer Loop** | `FileSessionManager` | Persist full conversation to disk | *Write* |\n",
    "\n",
    "This pairing ensures that:\n",
    "- The **active context** (short-term) stays clean and relevant.\n",
    "- The **session history** (long-term) remains available for recall, analysis, or summarization later.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It Matters in Enterprise Contexts\n",
    "\n",
    "In production-scale systems — customer assistants, multi-agent workflows, or regulated industries — proactive context management is critical for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consistency** → Prevent drift by constraining context size and order.  \n",
    "- **Cost-efficiency** → Control token growth across multi-turn conversations.  \n",
    "- **Compliance & Auditability** → Persist all interactions for review via session storage.  \n",
    "- **Scalability** → Maintain stable reasoning as conversations evolve over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Context engineering isn’t just about prompt design — it’s about lifecycle management.**  \n",
    "> The proactive trimming strategy governs what stays *in the model’s mind* (state/history),  \n",
    "> while session persistence governs what stays *on record* (memory).\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Next Step:**  \n",
    "We’ll build on this by adding summarization — compressing older context while keeping recent turns verbatim, merging *windowing* with *memory abstraction* for full context lifecycle management.\n"

    "## 🧠 Hybrid Context Management: Combining Trimming and Summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we’ve explored two key patterns:\n",
    "1. **Proactive Trimming** → Keep only the most recent turns (short-term state).  \n",
    "2. **Summarization** → Compress older turns into a concise summary (long-term memory).\n",
    "\n",
    "The next evolution is to **combine both strategies** into a single, adaptive system.  \n",
    "This `HybridSummarizingTurnTrimmer` demonstrates how an agent can intelligently balance *context depth* and *context efficiency*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation enforces two key parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Parameter | Description |\n",
    "|------------|-------------|\n",
    "| `context_limit` | Maximum number of user turns to keep in raw history before summarization triggers. |\n",
    "| `keep_last_n_turns` | Number of most recent turns to preserve exactly as they occurred. |\n",
    "\n",
    "When the number of user turns exceeds `context_limit`, the manager:\n",
    "1. **Counts user turns** in the current conversation.  \n",
    "2. **Summarizes everything before** the earliest of the last `keep_last_n_turns` turns.  \n",
    "3. **Injects a synthetic conversation pair**:\n",
    "   - `user`: “Summarize the conversation we had so far.”  \n",
    "   - `assistant`: *(generated summary)*  \n",
    "4. **Appends the recent turns** verbatim after the summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a natural conversation flow where the agent remembers prior context through a summary — just as a human might recall *“We already talked about that earlier…”* — while keeping the most recent details intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It Matters for Context Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "The hybrid model captures the full **context lifecycle**:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Context Layer | Strategy | Component | Goal |\n",
    "|:---------------|:----------|:-----------|:------|\n",
    "| **Active Context (short-term)** | Sliding window trimming | `SlidingWindowConversationManager` | Maintain focus and coherence |\n",
    "| **Summarized Memory (mid-term)** | Context compression | `_summarize_old_history()` | Preserve meaning, reduce token load |\n",
    "| **Persistent State (long-term)** | File-based storage | `FileSessionManager` | Enable recovery, auditing, continuity |\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these mechanisms form the backbone of **enterprise-grade context engineering**:\n",
    "- **Scalable** → Handles long, multi-session dialogues gracefully.  \n",
    "- **Composable** → Fits within multi-agent systems where each agent manages its own memory.  \n",
    "- **Explainable** → Summaries provide interpretable, inspectable history snapshots.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💬 In short: this hybrid design teaches your agent to *think like a human* —\n",
    "> remember the essence of what was said, forget unnecessary detail, and stay focused on what matters right now.\n"
